### Analysis of Goodbooks-10k dataset

(Original blog post)[https://tri47.github.io/2020/04/26/goodreads-dataset.html]
This repos is for the code I used to analyse the above dataset.  
Spark_script.ipynb notebook: The Spark code to run on Amazon EMR.    
emr_boostrap.sh and emr_cluster.sh: codes to run on AWS CLI to start a cluster on EMR.    
plot.ipynb: ipython notebook to plot the result.  
graph_gen.py: code to generate graph file for book network visualisation.  
This repo is very disorganised, use at your own risk.
